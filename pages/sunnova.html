                    <h2>Designing the Sunnova App: A UX Journey</h2>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>When I joined Sunnova, I was placed in the mobile app pod, where a third-party agency had initially provided an art direction. However, their involvement ended at the conceptual stage, leaving a gap between vision and functionality. My role was to take that foundation and refine it, integrating Sunnova's branding to develop a cohesive design system for the consumer app and other Sunnova products.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Research</h4>
                    <p>User research had not been conducted, and there were no tools or processes in place for gathering insights. To address this, I established an incentivized program that recruited Sunnova customers for 45-minute interviews. I began by exploring why customers were switching to alternative energy sources. Surprisingly, many were motivated by dissatisfaction with their current energy providers, in addition to seeking greener solutions.</p>
                    <p>Once I understood the reasons behind their transition to solar energy, I focused on assessing their need for an app. I introduced a prototype and gathered feedbackâ€”9 out of 10 interviewees expressed strong interest in using the app to monitor their energy production.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Design</h4>
                    <p>To create a user-friendly experience, I took a structured approach, ensuring customers could access live system performance metrics and historical energy production data. This transparency empowered users with valuable insights into their solar usage. The energy production graphs were designed with breakdowns by day, week, month, and year, allowing users to track trends and optimize consumption.</p>
                    <p>Given that the majority of the user base was 55+, I evaluated whether they could easily interpret the graph data during interviews. Additionally, understanding that solar energy production is influenced by weather conditions, I integrated localized weather patterns to help users anticipate efficiency fluctuations. For customers managing multiple solar systems, I introduced a feature that enabled seamless switching between locations, enhancing monitoring and management capabilities.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Implementation</h4>
                    <p>Collaborating with the management team, I defined the app's core functionalities based on what would deliver the most value to users. This led to a streamlined interface with clear sections tailored to user needs.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Evaluation</h4>
                    <p>With no established design team, I took a proactive approach in promoting a user-first mindset. Without dedicated research tools, I gathered insights by leveraging customer feedback from multiple channels and collaborating closely with stakeholders. Additionally, my team and I developed Sunnova's Design System by standardizing typography, color palette, and software components to ensure consistency and alignment with modern design standards.</p>

                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>The Sunnova app evolved into a well-structured, user-centric solution, providing customers with meaningful, real-time insights while reinforcing the company's brand identity. By bridging the gap between concept and execution, I developed a robust design system that laid the groundwork for future enhancements and scalability.</p>
