                    <h4>Background</h4>
                    <p>When I joined Sunnova, I was placed in the mobile app pod, where a third-party agency had already provided an initial art direction. However, their involvement stopped at the conceptual stage, leaving a gap between design vision and an actual, functional solution. My role was to take that foundation and build upon it, incorporating Sunnovaâ€™s branding to create a cohesive design system for the consumer app.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Identifying the Problems</h4>
                    <p>As I delved into the project, I quickly identified several critical challenges:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Lack of User Research:</b> No one had engaged directly with users to understand their needs.</li>
                            <li><b>Branding Gaps:</b> Sunnova lacked a defined brand font, and the existing brand guide was outdated.</li>
                            <li><b>No Research Tools:</b> There were no existing tools or methods in place for gathering user insights.</li>
                            <li><b>Absence of a Design Team:</b> Without a dedicated design team, cross-functional collaboration was limited.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Crafting the Solution</h4>
                    <p>To address these issues and create an intuitive, user-friendly app, I took a systematic approach.</p>
        
                    <h4>Incorporating Real-Time & Historical Data:</h4>
                    <p>I ensured that users could access live system performance metrics and historical energy production data, providing transparency and empowering customers with insights into their solar usage. Energy production graphs were broken down by day, week, month, and year, allowing users to track trends and optimize their consumption.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Prioritizing Essential Features:</h4>
                    <p>Collaborating with the management team, I worked to define the app's core functionalities based on what would be most valuable to end users. This led to a streamlined experience with clear sections that addressed user needs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Integrating Weather Data:</h4>
                    <p>Understanding that solar energy production is highly dependent on weather conditions, I incorporated localized weather patterns into the app, allowing users to see how upcoming weather changes might impact their system's efficiency.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Multi-System Support:</h4>
                    <p>I introduced a feature that allowed users with multiple solar systems to switch between locations seamlessly, improving their ability to manage and monitor each site.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Overcoming Challenges</h4>
                    <p>Since there was no existing design team, I had to take a hands-on approach in advocating for a user-first mindset. Without research tools, I had to be resourceful, leveraging customer feedback from other channels and working closely with stakeholders to gather insights. Additionally, I helped refresh Sunnova's brand by incorporating a standardized font and refining the brand guidelines to align with modern design standards.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>The Sunnova app became a well-structured, user-centric solution that provided customers with meaningful, real-time insights while enhancing the overall brand experience. By bridging the gap between the initial concept and a functional, polished product, I was able to create a robust design system that set the stage for future improvements and scalability.</p>
